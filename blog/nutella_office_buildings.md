## Nutella and Office Buildings

What do jars of Nutella&trade; and office buildings have in common? It sounds like the start of a bad joke but I want to make a serious point. Wastage - of anything - irks me to no end. I'm clearly not alone in this [1] but I wasn't aware of how big a problem it was until I did some research for this post.

Why do the manufactures of one of the world's most loved products design the jar in such a way that the last bit of Nutella stuck to the bottom cannot be removed? Not to mention - as an aside - the gold foil at the top. Is it too much to ask for a slight overhang to make it easier to peel off? I know you can use your nail, or a knife to cut around the edges; the knife may even be provided to you if you're not in the UK [2], but that's not the point. As an international brand who wants customers to love their product, Ferrero should really make it easier to peel open that foil. Anyway, tangent aside, the point is food packaging seems inherently wasteful.

How many people put in the effort, as I do, to stick their fingers in and scrape the bottom of the jar? You can even invest in a special knife [3] or use creative workarounds [4] to minimise wastage. With Nutella, it's probably a sizable number, but for other edible products, I doubt many do. Think ketchup, honey, or any semi-viscous condiment. With Hellman's mayo, I don't even know how much is left at the end, since the squeezy bottle is opaque [5]. For these products, and more, I'm in the habit of extracting every last bit before rinsing the container and recycling.

Some of you might question the relative impact - how much is _really_ wasted in Nutella jars or ketchup bottles? A sizeable portion it turns out. Anywhere between 15% and 25% of the container's contents [6][1] is simply thrown away becasue it could not be accessed. Add that to about 200 million gallons in the manufacturing process [7] and you're talking serious numbers. It's certainly enough for an MIT startup to focus on better storage solutions, and produce "no-stick ketchup bottles" [7]. Another aside - the physics of the solution is pretty cool, it's explained well in [1].

The other accusation you can throw at me is that I'm being frugal. I come from Mumbai, where there is a popular local phrase "paisa vasool" (ignore the movie of the same name). It loosely translates to value for money. I paid for 400g of Nutella, and I want 400g - not 395g and 5g going down the drain. This frugality, in Mumbai at least, is considered 'middle class' - surely you're not crying about the cost of 5g here. I'm sure part of me _does_ care about the financial side, but the main driver is to minimise waste.  Besides, there are many examples outside of food, where I don't have a direct cost.

Office buildings come to mind because I live near Canary Wharf, the financial hub of London. On my daily walks and runs over the last year, I have been past countless office buildings, at various times of day. High rise, glass exterior, lavish decorations - and fully lit, with more than ten(!) televisions on each floor, which are running 24 x 5 (if not 24 x 7). Even in a pre-Covid world, I would question the need for such electrical usage. However, given our current situation with many of these offices at 5% or 10% capacity, surely we don't need all the lights and TVs on [8], all the time. There is no excuse. I'm sure there are health and safety regulations that require emergency exit paths well lit but certainly not the rest of the floor. And reducing usage here would _definitely_ have a big impact [9].

We live in a world of abundance. There is always more if you need it, as long as you are willing to fork out the cash. The prevailing mindset is: if it's broke, replace it _not_ fix it. Minimising waste, using only what we need, is the sensible thing to go and not just for monetary reasons. As a planet, we overconsume by almost 78% - we need 1.78 Earths to sustain our current lifestyle [10]. Nutella jars and office buildings are (not so) small examples, but they exemplify our mindset, which is what I wanted to highlight in this post. We need to change.
