# Chores and the Second Law of Thermodynamics

The next time you are doing household chores, really think about how they make you feel. Rank the different tasks based on your preference; my observations are below, and I'd be keen to find out if you agree!

I've been lucky enough to be working from home for most of 2020 largely uninterrupted - my role doesn't require being in the office or a specific location [1]. Indeed, all I need is a laptop and a stable internet connection to work. There have been numerous perks (and downsides) of this, but one unique thing which I've started to "enjoy" is household chores. In a pre-Covid world, chores were - true to their definition - something that had to be done, a tedious but necessary evil. After a long day in the office - and a commute either side - the last thing anyone wants is to wash the dishes or do laundry. So, it became a weekend task. Where's the fun in that? The weekend is for relaxing and recuperation, or socialising; "I can't come to the pub because I need to vacuum the flat" is not an argument that's going to stand very long with my friends, and they and I both know it.

Over the last year, I've started interleaving my workday with household chores, and it has become something that I (almost) look forward to. For example, a nice break from work to load the dishwasher or hang up the clothes from the washing machine. It's procrastination at it's finest, because you're being productive without doing "work" (although maybe it should be work, without the quotes? [2]). With this new-found appreciation for chores, I also started analysing them more. How long does it take? When do I do them? I started planning ahead to the point that I blocked out parts of my calendar between meetings for these tasks. In addition to the usual breaks for cooking / eating lunch and going for a walk / run, it makes for a packed schedule! Of course, I don't want to take too many breaks, that would just be offset by a later log-off time despite best intentions...

With the increased analysis of chores, I started noticing patterns. Chores feel different, at least to me, because they reverse entropy to varying extents. Entropy can be thought of as the disorder in a system and the Second Law of Thermodynamics, approximately paraphrased, says that the entropy of a closed system always increases [3]. So whatever we try and do, nature wants to move from order to chaos [4]. A great example is available in [3], regarding the cleaning of your room. Notice how examples used to explain entropy often use household chores or related activities to convey the key concept. At its foundation, household chores are a fight against entropy [5].

Take a simple example - doing laundry. Taking the clothes from the basket to the machine doesn't particularly decrease the entropy - it was a dirty mess in the basket, it's no different in the washing machine. Therefore, loading the washing machine is low on the list of things I "enjoy". However, once the wash cycle is done, hanging up the clothes to dry is different. It takes a bundled mess from the dryer, and orders it nicely on the airer, giving a sense of satisfaction when everything is hung up in its rightful place. Going from messy to ordered is a small win in the losing battle against nature to decrease entropy. Henry Adams' quote sums it up pretty nicely: "Chaos was the law of nature; Order was the dream of man." [6]

The more a chore decreases entropy, the more keen I'm to get it done. Working from home v/s returning to office is a hotly contested topic, but one thing is for sure - I'll miss my household chores time through the day once I'm back!

My household chores ranking

Laundry
1. Hanging clothes up to dry on the airer - _big decrease in entropy_
2. Folding clothes to store in cupboard - _no change really, ordered to ordered_
3. Loading the washing machine from the laundry basket - _again no change, messy to messy!_

Dishes
1. Loading the dishwasher - _from the messy sink/kitchen to the nicely ordered racks_ ðŸ‘Œ
2. Washing the leftover dishes by hand, the ones that don't fit - _as per (1) but more effort..._
3. Unload the dishwasher or clear the drying rack - _ordered to ordered so no noticeable change_

Vacuum / General Cleaning
1. Just a one step process, but the feeling of a nice, clean flat after is definitely worth it ðŸ™‚
